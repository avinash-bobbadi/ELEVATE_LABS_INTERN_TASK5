# 🏦 Bank Account Simulation (Java OOP)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Java-based Bank Account Simulation** that demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **Encapsulation**, **Abstraction**, and **Composition**.  
It allows users to:
- Create a bank account
- Deposit and withdraw money
- Check account balance
- View complete **transaction history**

The program is **menu-driven** and runs in the console using `Scanner` for user input.

## 🚀 Features
- **Create an account** with account number, holder name, and initial balance
- **Deposit money** (amount must be positive)
- **Withdraw money** (cannot exceed balance)
- **Check account balance** at any time
- **Transaction history** with date, type, amount, and balance after each transaction
- **Menu-driven interface** for smooth interaction

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Java** (Core Java concepts)
- **OOP Principles**
- **`ArrayList`** for storing transaction history
- **`LocalDateTime`** for recording transaction timestamps
- **Scanner** for user input
